   - Identify growth trends in sell-out (SO) and sell-through (ST) metrics
     - Sell-through (ST): Sale of Viking's mobiles and accessories to its retailers
     - Sell-out (SO): Sale of those mobiles and accessories by retailers to customers


2. **Credit Management**:
   - Track outstanding bills by retailer
   - Categorize bills by age for better debt management
   - Provide Territory Sales Executive (TSE) specific reports for targeted follow-ups

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Highlight top-performing and underperforming retailers
   - Enable data-driven decisions for inventory management and sales strategies

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Identify retailers with aging credit for proactive risk mitigation
   - Support financial planning and cash flow management

5. **Inventory Cost Management**:
   - Track total inventory cost for each retailer
   - Assess potential financial exposure in case of retailer flight risk
   - Support inventory optimization and risk mitigation strategies

6. **Zero Stock Out (ZSO) Management**:
   - Identify ZSO situations where specific models have zero inventory
   - Enable proactive inventory management to prevent stockouts
   - Support data-driven decisions for inventory replenishment and risk mitigation

## Key Features

- **Growth Report**: Analyzes SO and ST data, calculates growth percentages, and generates color-coded Excel reports for easy interpretation.
- **Credit Report**: Processes bill data, categorizes by age, and creates separate reports for each TSE and missing TSE data.
- **COGS Report**: Calculates the total inventory cost for each retailer, assesses potential financial exposure in case of flight risk, and provides insights for inventory management.
- **Sales Report**: Fetches sales data from Excel files for each retailer, computes month-to-date sales performance, and generates detailed reports categorized by product types.
- **PriceList Report**: Generates a flat price list of SKUs for the current month, fetching price data from the zonal distributor and inventory data for material codes. Outputs a structured Excel report containing SKU Type, Model, Color, Variant, NLC (Net Landing Cost), MOP (Market Operating Price), MRP (Maximum Retail Price), and Material Code.
- **ZSO Report**: Identifies Zero Stock Out (ZSO) situations where specific models have zero inventory, combines sales and inventory data to determine ZSO status for each dealer, and generates an Excel report highlighting ZSO models and their respective dealers.
- **Automated Daily Generation**: Reports are automatically generated and saved with date-stamped directories for easy tracking and comparison.

By providing these daily reports, Viking Reports empowers businesses to make informed decisions, optimize operations, and drive growth while managing financial risks effectively.
